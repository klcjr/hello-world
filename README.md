Hello,

I am excited to learn everything this site has to offer.  

I really have no idea what goes here...  

With the help of a user guide, I have created the following:
  GitHub Account (klcjr)
  Repository (hello-world)
  New Issue
  New Branch (total of 2 --> master & readme-edits)
  Commit w/ message

Still not entirely sure what I'm doing here, but it's pretty cool!
